Logs and records management software made with PySimpleGUI

There are two version of it

1. Use a .bcele file to dump data and read from it.
2. Use MySQL to store database an data.

This was part of an University project and because of running out of time, no major validations are implemented in the software, as this is just an alpha version of it.
